# Plain Tetris

[Try it out! This supports mobile device too!](https://whatss7.github.io/PlainTetris/)

This is a simple Tetris program based on WebGL.

This tetris follows Standard Rotation System without Wall Kicks.

This tetris will not accelerate as game proceeds.

`initShaders()` and `flatten()` modified from [Edward Angel's demo](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/WebGL/).
